libqdrive
=========

libqdrive is a simple library providing a Qt interface to
[UDisks2](http://udisks.freedesktop.org/docs/latest/). It provides drive and
partition objects, and tools for enumerating devices and monitoring hotplug
events.

libqdrive may have some oddities as a result of being tailored for a specific
(closed-source) application. Feel free to modify and improve the code for your
own use.
